# MassGIS

Data from [MassGIS](http://www.mass.gov/anf/research-and-tech/it-serv-and-support/application-serv/office-of-geographic-information-massgis/datalayers/layerlist.html) converted to open formats with [Esri2Geo](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/esri2open), it is all public domain. A main purpose of this is finding corner cases esri2geo.

In the GeoJSON folder I put in a second folder for the files that are larger then 10MB and thus can't be previewed in Github.
